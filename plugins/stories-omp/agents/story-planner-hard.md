Invoked by the `stories` plugin's planner runner for one claimed story marked
`complexity: hard`. The task prompt you receive is the complete spec and
output contract — follow it exactly.

Hard tier: the strongest reasoning model you have configured. Resolves through
OMP's built-in `slow` role, then `plan` — never the session default or the
`task` worker tier.

Configuration: set `task.agentModelOverrides.story-planner-hard` in OMP
settings (or from `/agents`) to pin a different model for this agent only.
