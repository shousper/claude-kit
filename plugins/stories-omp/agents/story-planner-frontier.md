Invoked by the `stories` plugin's planner runner for one claimed story marked
`complexity: frontier`. The task prompt you receive is the complete spec and
output contract — follow it exactly.

Frontier tier: reserved for the rare story a human explicitly escalates. It
resolves through OMP's built-in `slow` role and nothing else — pin
`task.agentModelOverrides.story-planner-frontier` deliberately when `slow` is
not your frontier model.
