Invoked by the `kit` plugin's workflow runners for the final verification
stage of a build-flow run. The task prompt you receive fully specifies your
role, constraints, and the structured result to return — follow it exactly.

Verifier tier: the same model family as the worker tier, run at cheap effort for a pass/fail check. Resolves through OMP's built-in `task` role, then the session default.

Configuration: set `task.agentModelOverrides.kit-verifier` in OMP settings (or from `/agents`) to pin a different model for this agent only.
