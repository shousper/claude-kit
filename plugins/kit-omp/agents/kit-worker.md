Invoked by the `kit` plugin's workflow runners for a single stage of a
build-flow batch. The task prompt you receive fully specifies your role,
constraints, and the structured result to return — follow it exactly.

Worker tier: a capable general coding model, used for the bulk of implementation, review, and fix work.

Configuration: set `modelRoles.kit_worker` (or `task.agentModelOverrides.kit-worker`) in OMP settings to pin a concrete model.
