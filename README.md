# claude-kit

A Claude Code plugin marketplace hosting two plugins:

- **`kit`** (`plugins/kit/`) — a complete development workflow, from brainstorming ideas through design, implementation, code review, and branch completion.
- **`stories`** (`plugins/stories/`) — a story-based autonomous workflow built on kit: a repo-native markdown story board with typed verification gates and a goal loop that works the board until it is drained. See [plugins/stories/README.md](plugins/stories/README.md).

The remainder of this README documents `kit`.

**Philosophy:** You control when work enters git history. Kit accumulates changes locally, lets you review holistically, and commits only when you say so. Planning documents stay out of version control. PRs are always created as drafts.

## Install

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add shousper/claude-kit

# Install the core workflow plugin
/plugin install kit@shousper-kit

# Optional: story-based autonomous workflow (requires kit)
/plugin install stories@shousper-kit
```

## Recommended Plugins

None are required, but these complement kit well:

| Plugin | Provides | Install |
|--------|----------|---------|
| [commit-commands](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) | `/commit` command for conventional commits | `commit-commands@claude-code-plugins` |
| [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) | Persistent memory across sessions via automatic observation capture and semantic search | `claude-mem@thedotmack` |
| [pr-review-toolkit](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) | PR-focused review agents (silent failure hunting, type analysis, test coverage) | `pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins` |
| [code-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) | General code quality review agent | `code-review@claude-code-plugins` |

Install with `/plugin marketplace add <repo>` then `/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>`.

## Workflow

Kit's default workflow chain:

```
brainstorming → writing-plans → build-flow → finish-branch
```

1. **Brainstorm** — Explore the idea, refine requirements, approve design
2. **Write plan** — Detailed implementation plan with TDD steps (no commit steps)
3. **Build flow** — A background workflow implements tasks in batches with review gates
4. **Finish branch** — Commit approved work, push, create draft PR

Each stage flows into the next automatically. You can enter at any point if you already have what the earlier stages produce.

## Skills (18)

### Core Workflow

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | Design exploration before implementation — creates worktree on approval |
| `writing-plans` | Create bite-sized implementation plans with TDD steps |
| `build-flow` | Execute a plan via a background workflow with batch-boundary reviews |
| `finish-branch` | Complete development — commit, push, create draft PR |

### Development Practices

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `tdd` | Test-driven development — write failing test first, implement minimally |
| `debugging` | Systematic debugging before proposing fixes |
| `code-review` | Verify implementation meets requirements at review checkpoints |
| `receiving-review` | Handle code review feedback with technical rigor |
| `verify` | Run verification before claiming work is complete |

### Infrastructure

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `git-worktrees` | Create isolated git workspaces with smart directory selection |
| `worktree-cleanup` | Clean up worktrees when done — user-triggered only |
| `create-pr` | Create pull requests — drafts by default, uses repo PR template |
| `parallel-agents` | Dispatch independent tasks to parallel subagents |
| `github-work-summary` | Generate GitHub activity summaries for standups or reports |

### Meta

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `using-kit` | Skill discovery and usage patterns — loaded at session start |
| `writing-skills` | Create, edit, and test skills |

## Hooks

| Event | Hook | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| PostToolUse | `record.sh` | Write/Edit — records edited source paths (Go, Rust, JS/TS, HCL/Terraform/OpenTofu) to an agent-scoped scratch; never modifies files |
| Stop + SubagentStop | `format-on-stop.sh` | End of turn — formats the touched files and runs checks once, surfacing results as a single non-blocking message (advisory, not mid-turn blocking) |
| SessionStart | `session-start.sh` | Session startup, resume, clear, compact — kit intro and code-standards guidance |
| SessionStart | `hcl-detect.sh` | Startup/resume — one-time HCL tool-detection notice and scratch prune |

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews completed project steps against plans and coding standards |

## Code Standards

Bundled coding standards for automatic reference when working with:

- **Go** — formatting, error handling, project structure
- **Rust** — clippy lints, formatting, idiomatic patterns
- **Python** — style, type hints, project conventions
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility classes, component patterns

## Tools

### claude-mem Backfill

`tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs` — Backfills [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) with your historical Claude Code session logs. This is a workaround for claude-mem's currently broken import system.

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, claude-mem installed and running. Zero external dependencies.

```bash
# List discoverable sessions
node tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs --list

# Dry run — see what would be processed
node tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs --dry-run

# Run backfill (5 concurrent by default)
node tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs

# Only sessions after a date
node tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs --after 2025-01-01

# Single session
node tools/claude-mem-backfill.mjs --session <uuid>
```

Resumable — tracks state in `~/.claude-mem/backfill-state.json`. Safe to interrupt with Ctrl+C and re-run.

## Releases

The two plugins version and release independently. Tags follow the `<plugin>--vX.Y.Z` naming convention on `main` (first tags land when each plugin next releases — e.g. `kit--v1.2.0`, `stories--v0.1.0`):

- **kit** — version lives in `plugins/kit/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the marketplace entry
- **stories** — version lives in `plugins/stories/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the marketplace entry

To release: bump the version in the plugin's `plugin.json` **and** its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry, merge, then tag the merge commit.
